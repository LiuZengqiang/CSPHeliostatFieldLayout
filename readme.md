### Classical Concentrated Solar Power Field Data

This repository contains the solar tower power field data commonly used in concentrated solar power technology research.

There are [**Gemasolar**](#Gemasolar) data.

##### Gemasolar  

Gemasolar is located in Sevilla Spain, began in 2008, putted into operation in 2011.

The heliostats layout as follows:
